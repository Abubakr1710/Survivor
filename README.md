Titanic Survival Predictor
Introduction
This project is a web application that uses a Machine Learning model to predict whether or not a person would have survived on the Titanic. Users input their age, sex, and passenger class, and the model outputs a prediction of survival. The website also includes Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore the data and provide insights.

Technologies Used
This project uses a variety of technologies, including:

HTML: for the website structure and layout
CSS: for styling the website
Bootstrap: for responsive design and additional styling
Python: for data preprocessing and Machine Learning
Numpy: for numerical computing
Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib: for data visualization
Flask: for the web application framework
Features
Users can input their age, sex, and passenger class to get a survival prediction
The website includes EDA to explore the Titanic dataset
The website is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
