### *Introduction*
This project is a web application that uses a _Machine Learning model_ to predict whether or not a person would have survived on the _Titanic_. Users input their age, sex, and passenger class, and the model outputs a prediction of survival. The website also includes _Explanatory Data Analysis_ (EDA) to explore the data and provide insights.

### *Technologies Used*
This project uses a variety of technologies, including:
```
HTML: for the website structure and layout
CSS: for styling the website
Bootstrap: for responsive design and additional styling
Python: for data preprocessing and Machine Learning
Numpy: for numerical computing
Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib: for data visualization
Flask: for the web application framework
```

### *Features*
Users can input their age, sex, and passenger class to get a survival prediction
The website includes EDA to explore the Titanic dataset
The website is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
The website is easy to use and has a clean, modern design

### *Website*
You can access the website at the following link: [There will be link after the project completion]

### *Credits*
This project was inspired by the _Kaggle_ _Titanic_ _competition_, which provided the dataset used for the _Machine Learning model_. Thanks to the open source community for creating and maintaining the libraries used in this project.
